# Vulnerable-Extension
This is a browser extension built using Chrome's native Summarizer API. While the extension itself is not intentionally vulnerable, it serves as a practical example to explore how summarizers can unintentionally process hidden or styled content in ways that may lead to invisible prompt injection.

The goal is to raise awareness around the potential risks of summarizing raw web content and encourage safer design patterns in future AI-integrated tools.
